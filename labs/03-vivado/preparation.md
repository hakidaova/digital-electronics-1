## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

The Nexys A7 board provides sixteen switches and LEDs. The switches can be used to provide inputs, and the LEDs can be used as output devices.

1. See [schematic](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/digital-electronics-1/blob/master/docs/nexys-a7-sch.pdf) or [reference manual](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/reference-manual) of the Nexys A7 board and find out the connection of slide switches and LEDs, ie to which FPGA pins are connected and how. Draw the schematic.

2. **Optional task:** Follow the instructions for [Windows or Linux](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/digital-electronics-1/wiki/List-of-versions), download and install Vivado Design Suite.
